# XSLT Kit

This template collection combines XSLT utilities we regularly use in our projects. Some templates require a specific XML structure provided by our [Kirby XSLT plugin](https://github.com/hananils/kirby-xslt). If you are working with Symphony CMS, have a look at the [dedicated branch](https://github.com/hananils/xslt-kit/tree/symphony).
